TI  - Florida's Opioid Crackdown and Mortality From Drug Overdose, Motor Vehicle Crashes, 
      and Suicide: A Bayesian Interrupted Time-Series Analysis.

AB  - In 2011, Florida established a prescription drug monitoring program and adopted new 
      regulations for independent pain-management clinics. We examined the association of 
      those reforms with drug overdose deaths and other injury fatalities. Florida's 
      postreform monthly mortality rates-for drug-involved deaths, motor vehicle crashes, 
      and suicide by means other than poisoning-were compared with a counterfactual 
      estimate of what those rates would have been absent reform. The counterfactual was 
      estimated using a Bayesian structural time-series model based on mortality trends in 
      similar states. By December 2013, drug overdose deaths were down 17% (95% credible 
      interval: -21, -12), motor vehicle crash deaths were down 9% (95% credible interval: 
      -14, -4), and suicide deaths were unchanged compared with what would be expected in 
      the absence of reform. Florida's opioid prescribing reform substantially reduced 
      drug overdose deaths. Reforms may also have reduced motor vehicle crash deaths but 
      were not associated with a change in suicides. More research is needed to understand 
      these patterns. Bayesian structural time-series modeling is a promising new approach 
      to interrupted time-series studies.
