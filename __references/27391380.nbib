TI  - Tear gas: an epidemiological and mechanistic reassessment.

AB  - Deployments of tear gas and pepper spray have rapidly increased worldwide. Large 
      amounts of tear gas have been used in densely populated cities, including Cairo, 
      Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Manama (Bahrain), and Hong Kong. In the United States, 
      tear gas was used extensively during recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Whereas 
      tear gas deployment systems have rapidly improved-with aerial drone systems tested 
      and requested by law enforcement-epidemiological and mechanistic research have 
      lagged behind and have received little attention. Case studies and recent 
      epidemiological studies revealed that tear gas agents can cause lung, cutaneous, and 
      ocular injuries, with individuals affected by chronic morbidities at high risk for 
      complications. Mechanistic studies identified the ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 as 
      targets of capsaicin in pepper spray, and of the tear gas agents chloroacetophenone, 
      CS, and CR. TRPV1 and TRPA1 localize to pain-sensing peripheral sensory neurons and 
      have been linked to acute and chronic pain, cough, asthma, lung injury, dermatitis, 
      itch, and neurodegeneration. In animal models, transient receptor potential 
      inhibitors show promising effects as potential countermeasures against tear gas 
      injuries. On the basis of the available data, a reassessment of the health risks of 
      tear gas exposures in the civilian population is advised, and development of new 
      countermeasures is proposed.
